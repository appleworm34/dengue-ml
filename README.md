# Dengue: Predicting Disease Spread

## About

This is a mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)
Our project focuses on predicting the total cases of dengue given the environmental and climate data of a given area.

## Problem Definition

- Can we predict the total number of Dengue cases based on the environmental and climate data?
- Which model among the ones we selected would be the best to predict it?

## Data source

- [DrivenData - DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/data/)

## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machine

## Conclusion

- 

## What we learnt from this project:

- Collaborating using GitHub
- Different methods of filling in NULL values (interpolation)
- Complete flow of analysing and trying to solve a machine learning problem
- K-Nearest Neighbours for regression
- Support Vector Machine for regression
- Feature scaling
- K-Fold Cross Validation
